This repo is set to reproduce the results of `Semi-Supervised Learning by Augmented Distribution Alignment` using PyTorch.


Using `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to add my personal base library for deep learning.

Freshly new to tensorflow, I try to implement the paper based on the [original repo]('https://github.com/qinenergy/adanet').
Details would not perfectly matched.
